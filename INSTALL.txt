AnalysisDevelop and AnalysisStable

The AnalysisDevelop system has the sources of each module and AnalysisStable has
the 'stable' sources (and includes) and the libraries of each module.  The
compilation of a module that depends on other modules uses the sources and libraries
in AnalysisStable.

0. Stable System Setup
   In the AnalysisStable directory there are the libraries and modules
   that are considered stable.  Two environment variables must point
   to where this directory is.  In a bash shell this would be done with:
         export CodeBase=/usr/share/AnalysisStable
         export ANALYSIS_BASE=/usr/share/AnalysisStable

 1. AnalysisDevelop Setup
    Associated with the module developement part is an environment variable:
         export ANALYSIS_DEVBASE=/usr/share/AnalysisDevelop
